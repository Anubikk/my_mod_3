//     In the server.js file under Phase 1, create a route handler for GET /.

// The route handler will display the new-player.html view page. (Don't forget to specify that the encoding is utf-8 for the fs.readFileSync)

// Set your route up so that it will replace the availableRooms variable with the string returned from the availableRoomsToString() instance method, which was imported from the World instance at the top of the file.

// Complete the status code, headers, etc.

   if(req.method === 'GET' && req.url === '/') { // If the request is a GET request and the url is '/'
      let view = fs.readFileSync('./views/new-player.html', 'utf-8'); // Read the new-player.html file

      res.write(view); // Write the view to the response
      res.end(); // End the response
    }

    // Phase 2: POST /player
//     Create a route handler for POST /player.

// Obtain the room ID and name from the request. (Hint: You can use destructuring to achieve this!)

// Create a new player with the info obtained. Make sure you are NOT creating the player directly with the room ID, and is instead passing in the room object of the chosen room into the new player.

// Redirect the client to the route /rooms/:roomId where the :roomId route parameter is replaced with the starting room of the newly created player.

     if(req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/player') { // If the request is a POST request and the url is '/player'
      const { roomId, name } = req.body; // Obtain the room ID and name from the request
      player = new Player(name, world.getRoomById(roomId)); // Create a new player with the info obtained
      res.writeHead(302, {'Location': `/rooms/${player.room.id}`}); // Redirect the client to the route /rooms/:roomId
      res.end(); // End the response
    }

    // Phase 3: GET /rooms/:roomId

//     Note: All route handlers after phase 2 should require a player. Type in your code before the route handler of Phase 3 to redirect to the home page if there is no player. Since redirect will be use a lot, consider adding a helper function for that.

// Create a route handler for GET /rooms/:roomId.

// Obtain the current room Id by parsing the URL.

// Update the html file for room.html to replace all the variables with details obtained from the player's current room.

// Complete the status code, headers, etc.

// Make sure to test this route by starting the server and on the browser, navigate to the home page, submit a new player, and make sure the redirect from phase 2 works.

// Redirect to the current room
// If the specified :roomId route parameter is not the roomId of the player's current room, then the server's response should redirect the client to the correct current room of the player instead of displaying the room.html view page as the response.




    // Phase 4: GET /rooms/:roomId/:direction

    // Phase 5: POST /items/:itemId/:action

    // Phase 6: Redirect if no matching route handlers
